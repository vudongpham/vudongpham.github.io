## About Me
I am a researcher and PhD specializing in **continental-scale land-cover mapping** and **deep learning for Earth observation**. At the [EO Lab, University of Greifswald](https://geo.uni-greifswald.de/en/chairs/geographie/translate-to-english-fernerkundung-und-geoinformationsverarbeitung/), I work on scalable and consistent land-cover characterization across extensive spatial and temporal domains. My work integrates research and engineering by developing transferable geospatial models and datasets and deploying them on high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud infrastructures.
