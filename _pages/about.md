## About Me
I am researcher, PhD, specializing in **continental-scale land-cover mapping** and **deep learning for Earth observation**. I work at the [EO Lab, University of Greifswald](https://geo.uni-greifswald.de/en/chairs/geographie/translate-to-english-fernerkundung-und-geoinformationsverarbeitung/) and focus on consistent land-cover mapping across large spatial and temporal domains. I bridge research and engineering by designing transferable models/datasets and deploying them on HPC and cloud platforms.
