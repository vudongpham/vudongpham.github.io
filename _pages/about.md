<p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 18px;" >Hi, I am Dong, currently working as PhD student in <b><a href='https://geo.uni-greifswald.de/en/chairs/geographie/translate-to-english-fernerkundung-und-geoinformationsverarbeitung/'>Earth Observation and Geoinformation Science Lab Institute for Geography and Geology, University of Greifswald, Germany</a></b> I work with Earth Observation 🛰️ (EO) data, and like to implement ideas from other fields into EO field to see how they turn out. 

<p style="line-height: 2; font-size: 18px;" >My works focus on big EO data for large-scale mappings 🗺️, with parallelizations 🖧, and efficient processings ⚙️! Especially, I like to work with historical EO data, when things were noisy and ugly. That's why my entire PhD dedicated to <b><i>Transferability</i></b> and <b><i>Generalization</i></b>, so that I could bring technologies from the present to map back to the past ⌛.</p>
