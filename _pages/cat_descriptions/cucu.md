I am cucu the little bird 🦅 because I like to be on the air (jumping) all the time: Trees 🌴, furnitures 🛋️, electronic devices 📺.

I did not choose the wildlife, the wildlife chose me. Neighbors call me "Cucu the pirate 🏴‍☠️". 

I have the loudest "Meow" 🔊 of all the cats, and I like to meow for attentions, especially in the middle of the night when everyone else is peacefully sleeping 💤.

People say I hate <b>Shrimp</b>, but I only hate him only when he is: eating, sleeping, standing, laying, and breathing. That all 😒.
