This post summarises my presentation at the [Living Planet Symposium 2025](https://lps25.esa.int/) (Vienna, 26 June 2025).

### **Mapping land-cover and crop types requires dense Sentinel-2 time-series**

- **Sentinel-2** imagery has been available since 2015, offering a five-day revisit cycle.<br><br>
- Mapping historical crop types is difficult because the older **Landsat** archive provides a much coarser temporal resolution.<br>

### **The temporal-transferability challenge**

- Deep learning (DL) has become ubiquitous in remote sensing over the past decade.<br><br>
- Most training data have been collected during the Sentinel-2 era.<br><br>  
- Consequently, DL models trained on dense Sentinel-2 series must often be transferred to periods when only Landsat data are available.<br>

### **Conventional gap-filling methods degrade over time**

- Accurate crop mapping demands gap-free phenological trajectories.<br><br>  
- Numerous temporal gap-filling algorithms exist, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>  
- Nevertheless, a model calibrated on dense Sentinel-2 data performs poorly when appliedâ€”unchangedâ€”to sparser Landsat series.<br>

### **Temporal Encoding: a universal time-series representation**

- For each year, we allocate a 365-element vector corresponding to every day of the year.<br><br>  
- Each clear observation is inserted at the position matching its acquisition date.<br><br>  
- Unobserved days filled with **0** value â€”there is **no interpolation**, **no resampling**, **no parameterization** and **raw data is preserved**.<br>

If visualised as a 2-D image, a temporally encoded series appears as follows:

### **Why preserving raw information is important**

### **Temporal Encoding provides an equidistant feature space for diverse DL architectures**

### **Mapping results**

- The approach yields annual land-cover maps from 2000 to 2022 at continental scale.<br><br>  
- Detailed information on croplands and peatlands.

### **Land-cover monitoring examples**

**Example 1 â€“ Crop rotation in Poland (2000â€“2022).**
It is noted that the deep model was trained on crop reference data from only three years (2019, 2021, 2022), yet generalized across two decades.
